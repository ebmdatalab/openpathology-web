"""
Pre-calculate totals for prescribing over all presentations. We sometimes need
these values (e.g. to show prescribing of X as a percentage of all prescribing)
and they're slightly too expensive to calculate at runtime (45-60 seconds).

The resulting matrices are the same shape as the rest of the matrices and thus
contain individual totals for each practice and month.
