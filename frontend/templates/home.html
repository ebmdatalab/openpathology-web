      OpenPathology: supporting better diagnostic testing</h1>
    <p class="lead">We are <a href="{% url 'about' %}">a team</a> based at <a href="https://ebmdatalab.net/">the DataLab</a>  at the
      University of Oxford.  We're developing free, open tools for analysing pathology data in the NHS. These will give clinicians simple and actionable insights, to improve patient care and reduce costs. <a href="{% url 'get_involved' %}" class="btn btn-warning">Get involved</a></p>

  <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <p>Better audit and feedback about test requests in primary care has the potenital to <strong>improve patient safety</strong> and <strong>reduce costs</strong> significantly:
    <ul>
      <li>
    England sees <strong>1.12 billion tests per year</strong>, costing Â£2.2 billion, 35-45% of which are requested from primary care (<a href="https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/pathology-networks/">source</a>).</li>
      <li>Testing rates are <strong>increasing rapidly</strong>: patients in 2001 had on average 1.5 tests per year; five years later they were having <strong>5 tests per year</strong> (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30487169">source</a>).</li>
      <li>There is <strong>huge, often unwarranted variation</strong> in tests (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29556075">source</a>), which can lead to patient harm and unecessary costs.</li>
      <li>Quality improvement studies have already demonstrated the potential to <strong>reduce costs and patient harm</strong> without impacting outcomes (<a href="https://bmjopenquality.bmj.com/content/8/1/e000349">source</a>).</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>What will it look like?</h2>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <p>Our prototype system will focus on primary care. Practices will be able view a range of test orders and results, in the context of their peers. As well as charts, all data will downloadable for further analysis. We will write a series of papers exploring trends and variation across the data.</p>

  <p>Data will be presented on this website, in dashboards similar to the ones we developed for OpenPrescribing (<a href="https://openprescribing.net/practice/L83073/">example</a>). As an example, here's how we might show potassium test ordering and results for a single practice:</p>

  <div class="col-sm">
    <figure class="figure">
      <figcaption class="figure-caption figure-caption-title">Number of Potassium tests per person</figcaption>
      <img src="{% static 'example_1.png' %}" alt="Chart showing potassium ordering" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail">
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">This practice requests relatively more than other practices in the CCG.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm">
    <figcaption class="figure-caption figure-caption-title">Proportion of potassium tests that are high</figcaption>
    <img src="{% static 'example_2.png' %}" alt="Another chart showing potassium ordering" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail">
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">You can see big winter peaks across the region, but this practice has reduced the seasonal fluctuation in high potassiums, and reduced the baseline across the year. <a href="https://girftpathology.blogspot.com/2019/06/pseudohyperkalemia-dangerous-expensive.html">Read more</a>.</caption>
