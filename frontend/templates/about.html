      OpenPathology is a new project being built by
      the <a href="https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/about-us/">Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science</a> at
      the University of Oxford.  Alongside our existing Bennett Institute team,
      we are pleased to be working with physician and
      researcher <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/208516">Jack
      O’Sullivan</a>, and consultant medical microbiologist Tom Lewis,
      joint clinical lead for the NHS Improvement ‘Getting It Right
      First Time’
      (GIRFT) <a href="https://gettingitrightfirsttime.co.uk/clinical-work-stream/pathology/">Pathology
      programme</a>.
    </p>
    <p>   In spring 2019 we
    were awarded
    funding to carry out reserach and build a prototype tool, to be delivered by the end of the year.

          We are the team
          behind <a href="https://openprescribing.net/">OpenPrescribing.net</a>,
          an openly accessible tool for all NHS primary care
          prescribing data. On OpenPrescribing you can explore
          variation over time and place in prescribing for any
          individual drug, or class of drugs, right down to the level
          of individual practices. You can explore outliers, and see
          which practices are fast or slow to respond to changes in
          price, or changes in the evidence on safety and
          effectiveness. You can see standard dashboards for every
          practice and CCG, and subscribe to “prescribing alerts”
          driven by cutting edge data science techniques.
