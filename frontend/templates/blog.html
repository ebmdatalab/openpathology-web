      This is the third instalment in our series of commentaries on using
      reference ranges to interpret pathology test results. Reference ranges
      vary between labs Classically, the reference range is defined
      statistically: it is the interval …

      This is the second installment in our series of commentaries on reference
      ranges used to interpret pathology test results. Here we describe two
      issues relating to how meaningful reference ranges are. Reference ranges
      are usually …

      As the OpenPathology project has progressed, we have started to build
      measures to describe variation between practices, and groups of practices.
      While comparing rates of requests per head of population can be used as a

      In our initial analyses of pathology data from the South West for our

      In our initial analyses of pathology data from the South West for our
      OpenPathology.net project, we have noticed subtle but consistent variation
      in haemoglobin test results throughout the year. Haemoglobin (Hb) levels
      falling below certain …

      At OpenPathology, we’ve already found interesting variation in test
      request rates between practices, but we’d also like to compare whole
      laboratories. The number of tests per patient is an important measure for
      understanding variation in …

      OpenPathology is our project exploring and feeding back to clinicians on
      their test requesting rates. Having established that patient counts are
      subject to some inaccuracy in existing analyses (see our previous blog),
      it’s important to …

      We are excited to reveal some of the data for our new OpenPathology.net
      project. Similar to our previous project for NHS prescribing data
      openprescribing.net, we are developing free, open dashboards for analysing
      NHS pathology data. …
